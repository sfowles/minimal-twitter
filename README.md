# Minimal Twitter (dark mode)

Forked from the great work here: [antoniocarusone/minimal-twitter](https://github.com/antoniocarusone/minimal-twitter). Updated for dark mode, and to display threads together.

Minimal Twitter is a Boost for [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) that cleans up the UI with a minimal design that eliminates distractions and prioritizes reading.
